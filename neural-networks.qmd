## Anatomy of a Neural Network


Layers: Input → Hidden layers → Output.

Each neuron computes... Introduce weights, bias, act8ivation function

## Activation Function

Sigmoid, ReLU, tanh


## Forward Pass

Compute the output from input.
Calculate loss (MSE, cross-entropy)

## Backpropagation

Use chain rule to compute gradients of loss w.r.t. weights.

Intuitive derivation, no need for full algebraic proof.


## Gradient Descent
Rule for updating weights

## Training
Batch vs stochastic gradient descent
Loss evolution: training loss vs. validation loss → early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Hyperparameters: learning rate, network depth, regularization, batch size.

Regularization techniques:

L2 weight decay

Dropout

Early stopping

## Deep Learning

Multiple hidden layers allow hierarchical feature extraction.
Early layers learn simple features (edges, patterns).
Deeper layers combine them into complex representations.
Featurisation.

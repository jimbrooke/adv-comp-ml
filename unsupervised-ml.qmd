## Clustering
K-means clustering
Hierarchical clustering.
DBSCAN.


## Dimensionality Reduction
PCA
t-SNE
UMAP

## Evaluation & Interpretation

No ground truth: how do we know if unsupervised learning succeeded?

Use internal validation (e.g., silhouette score for clustering).

Compare discovered patterns to known physics features.

Interpretability:

PCA axes may correspond to physical modes or may not.

Clusters may or may not align with real physical classes.

Visualization:

2D projections, cluster coloring, dendrograms.

Demonstrate how PCA + k-means can reveal structure in physical datasets.

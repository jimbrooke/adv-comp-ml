## Supervised Learning Framework

Training set, model, loss, optimisation, validation


## Regression

Linear regression

Minimisation of mean squared error

Connection to maximum likelihood estimation under Gaussian noise

Polynomial regression and basis expansion

Regularisation (L2, L1)

## Classification

Logistic regression

Negative log-likelihood loss (cross-entropy)

Connection to MLE under Bernoulli model

Alternatives : k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN). Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

## Evaluating model performance

Regression metrics. MSE, RMSE, $R^2$

Classification metrics. accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves.

Train/test split.  Cross-validation.

Demonstrate visually how overfitting and underfitting appear in training vs. validation error plots.

## Bias, Variance, Overfitting

Define biasâ€“variance trade-off.

Overfitting in physics context: model fits noise rather than real phenomena.

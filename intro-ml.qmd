## What is Machine Learning ?

Machine learning is the study of algorithms that enable computers to learn patterns or relationships from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Core idea: Instead of coding physics laws explicitly, we let algorithms infer structure or relationships.

Traditional physics → build models from first principles.
Machine learning → learn models from data when physical models are incomplete, complex, or computationally expensive.

## Examples in Physics

| Area                                | Example Use                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **High-energy physics**             | Event classification in particle detectors            |
| **Condensed matter**                | Detecting phase transitions in spin models            |
| **Astrophysics**                    | Galaxy morphology classification, transient detection |
| **Quantum physics**                 | Neural-network quantum states (Carleo & Troyer, 2017) |
| **Plasma physics**                  | ML-based control of magnetic confinement              |
| **Computational materials science** | Surrogate models for interatomic potentials           |


## Types of learning

| Category                   | Goal                                       | Example Task                         | Example Physics Application                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supervised Learning**    | Learn mapping (x \to y) from labelled data | Regression, classification           | Predict energy levels from system parameters; classify detector events |
| **Unsupervised Learning**  | Discover structure in unlabelled data      | Clustering, dimensionality reduction | Identify phases of matter, cluster spectral data                       |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Learn by interacting with environment      | Sequential decision-making           | Control plasma confinement, optimize experiments                       |


## Opportunities, Challenges, Ethics

Opportunities:

Handle high-dimensional, noisy data.

Speed up simulations (surrogate modeling).

Enable discovery in large datasets.

Challenges:

Interpretability — what does the ML model “understand”?

Overfitting — learning noise, not physics.

Data bias and uncertainty quantification.

Ethical use — transparency, reproducibility, sustainability.

How do we ensure scientific rigor when using ML in physics?

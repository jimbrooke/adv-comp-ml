# Introduction

Welcome to the course notes for Advanced Computational Physics and Machine Learning.

These notes will introduce the material covered in lectures and problems classes. They will be supplemented by lecture slides and example programming problems.

The notes will be released in four blocks for each half teaching block. The first block will cover numerical methods, as well as some advanced programming techniques :

1. Introduction
2. Advanced Python Programming
3. Linear Algebra
4. Monte Carlo Methods

Future blocks will cover further data science techniques, machine learning and high performance computing.

## Pre-requisites

These notes assume you have studied computational physics up to 2nd year (Level 5), such as PHYS20035 (Computational Physics and Data Science) or SCIF20002 (Programming and Data Analysis for Scientists).
